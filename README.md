Autism Buddie is an app designed to assist autistic children with their parents or teaching aids. A-Buddie takes advantage of the novelty of a smart watch, creating an customizable and fun user experience for the child. The adult then uses a phone app to set reminders for the child, help engage them in social-practise games, or send trivia on their favorite topics. All of these functionalities are themed to the child's interest (e.g Pok√©mon, Minecraft, etc.) so the child remains interested in and enjoys this interaction.

Key functionalities of the app are:
  
  -Face Matching - this simple game shows a person's face, and the child chooses whether the face is happy or sad. 
  -Reminders - the parent can send reminders to the child
  -Trivia - themed to the child's topic of choice, this exposes to a wealth of information related to what they care about
  
The basis for A-Buddie was twofold. 

Firstly, there are a plethora of resources that agree: technology helps bridge the communication gap in autistic children. From scholarly articles to family testimonials, there seems to be a consensus that new technology can help bring skills, information, and productivity to an ASD child's fingertips.

Secondly, autistic children seem to develop fixations on certain topics. Specifically, they can develop an intense interests. These interests are an easy-found common ground, and often lead to a child learning a lot on this topic. A - Buddie works with these fixations with a few goals in mind- 1) Help calm the child with something that soothes them, 2) engage the child and help parents and aids communicate via a topic that interests them, and 3) provide a wealth of information that can possibly educate the child or even lead to new interests or research.
